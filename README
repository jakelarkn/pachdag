Initializing and Parsing the DAG is O(V+E) time and space complexity  V= num nodes   E= num edges

Calculating leaves()  is O(V) time and space  as we use in_degree hash to find


For the ancestors() method performance  this is DFS on a graph so
    #           time complexity  O(V+E)   V=number of nodes  E=numberof ehdge
    #           spece complexity O(V+E)    size of the result which is order of V


#  Discussion:  for bisectors we need to know the number of ancestors at every nodes.
    #   a naive solution might be to call ancestors() at every node and count
    #   but this is at least O(V^2 E) time
    #   my optimization is to first do a topoligical sort of the graph.
    #   we are guaranteed graph is acyclic and has a possible topological ordering
    #   with the top sort  we can progress from the roots down to the leaves.
    #  the count of ancestors for any particular node is the the number of direct
    #  ancestors plus their the number of ancestors we've already pre-calcuated at each direct ancestor.

    #  I implemented topological sort via DFS  but Kahns Algorithm is a possiblity
    #  Topological Sort is  O(V+E) time complexity

    #  My final step is to calculate the group of bisectors but iterating thru the
    #  dictionary hash that counts num_ancestors at each node   O(V)

    # total time here   O(V+E)

    #   its possible to optimize this code tocount the number of ancestors during the Topological
    #   Sort phase, esp if you are using Kahns algorithm which uses  indeg/outdegree
    #  however this was easier for me to implement and reason about within the time constraints
